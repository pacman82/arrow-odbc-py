# Changelog

## 1.2.0

- Introduce `enable_odbc_connection_pooling` to allow for reducing overhead then creating "new" connections.

## 1.1.3

- Update Rust dependencies

## 1.1.2

- Declare minimal version in pyproject.toml

## 1.1.1

- Fix version number in documentation.

## 1.1.0

- Update Rust dependencies
- Adds `log_to_stderr` for emitting diagnostics directly to standard output.

## 1.0.1

- More code examples in Docstrings

## 1.0.0

- Breaking change: `read_arrow_batches_from_odbc` now also returns a batch reader instead of `None`, even if the SQL statement did not produce a result set. The resulting reader will be empty, i.e. iterating over batches stops immediatly. The assaciated schema attribute will contain no columns.
- Support for querying stored procedures returning multiple result sets is added. Call `more_results` on the reader to advance to the next result set.

## 0.3.14

- Update Rust dependencies
- Add `from_table_to_db` to better support insertion directly from an arrow header rather than a record batch reader.

## 0.3.13

- Support for inserting large binary strings

## 0.3.12

- Fix: If an error occurrs during inintalizing the writer it is now correctly translated into a python exception interrupting the control flow befor accessing an invalid writer object. Before this fix an error would have caused an invalid memory access violation.

## 0.3.11

- Fix manylinux wheel build

## 0.3.10

- Support for explicit login timeout in seconds via the `login_timeout_sec` parameter in both `read_arrow_batches_from_odbc` and `insert_into_table`.
- Updated Rust dependencies

## 0.3.9

- Updated Rust dependencies
  - This includes an update to `odbc-api 0.54.0`. This avoids escalating into an error if a query emits at least 32767 warnings.

## 0.3.8

- Fix: Be resilient against ineterior `Nul`s in error messages.

## 0.3.7

- Updated Rust dependencies
- Better error message in case the ODBC driver emits more than 32767 diagnostic records then fetching data.

## 0.3.6

- Rerelease due to failed build of windows wheel.
- Update Rust dependencies

## 0.3.5

- Update Rust dependencies

## 0.3.4

- Update Rust dependencies

## 0.3.3

- Update Rust dependencies

## 0.3.2

- Disabled arrow default features again for leaner build. They had been enabled to workaround an upstream bug, there the `ffi` feature has not been self reliant. This update uses a smaller workaround and only enables the `ipc` feature in addition to `ffi`.

## 0.3.1

- Update Rust dependencies

## 0.3.0

- Use narrow strings on non-windows platforms. Assumes Sytem locale with UTF-8.

## 0.2.6

- Docs are now available on <http://arrow-odbc.readthedocs.org>

## 0.2.5

- `BatchWriter` is now "public" in top level scope.
- Test release pipeline using `maturin` instead of `setuptools` with `milksnake`.
- Fix: Non-linux wheels are no longer tagged to support Python 2

## 0.2.4

- Update Rust dependencies

## 0.2.3

- Update Rust dependencies

## 0.2.2

- Support for inserting `Decimal256`

## 0.2.1

- Updated Rust dependencies

## 0.2.0

- Support for inserting record batches into a database table
- `BatchReader` now exposes `schema` as an attribute rather than a function.

## 0.1.23

- Updated Rust dependencies

## 0.1.22

- Updated Rust dependencies

## 0.1.21

- Add paramater `falliable_allocations` to give users the option to opt out of falliable allocations, and potential performance overhead.

## 0.1.20

- Support specifying an upper limit for text and binary columns. This allows to circumvent allocation and or zero sized column errors.

## 0.1.19

- Raise exception in case buffer allocation fails instead of panicing.

## 0.1.18

- Updated Rust dependencies

## 0.1.17

- Updated Rust dependencies
  
## 0.1.16

- Updated Rust dependencies

## 0.1.15

## 0.1.14

- Support for positional query parameters
- Updated dependencies

## 0.1.13

- Improved error messages.

## 0.1.12

Fix: There had been an issue, there the correct binary size for the longest possible text has been underestimated on Linux then querying a column with UTF-8 encoded characters.

## 0.1.11

- Fix: There had been an issue, there the correct binary size for the longest possible text has been underestimated on Linux then querying a column with UTF-16 encoded characters.
- Fix: There had been an issue, there the correct binary size for the longest possible text has been underestimated on Windown then querying a column with UTF-8 encoded characters.

## 0.1.10

- Allow specifying user and password seperatly from the connection string.

## 0.1.9

- Fix: Manylinux wheel are now build against a recent version of Unix ODBC and link against the `libodbc.so` provided by the system.

## 0.1.8

Fix: An upstream issue causing overflows for `timestamp['us']` has been fixed.

## 0.1.7

- Fix: `BatchReader.__next__()` now returns `pyarrow.RecordBatch`. Previous version returned a `StructArray`.
- Fix: `BatchReader.schema()` now return `pyarrow.Schema` instead of `pyarrow.Datatype`.

Replace maturin with milksnake
