        the column If you can not adapt your database schema, this limit might be what you are
        looking for. On windows systems the size is double words (16Bit), as windows utilizes an
        UTF-16 encoding. So this translates to roughly the size in letters. On non windows systems
        this is the size in bytes and the datasource is assumed to utilize an UTF-8 encoding.
        ``None`` means no upper limit is set and the maximum element size, reported by ODBC is used
        to determine buffer sizes.
    :param max_binary_size: An upper limit for the size of buffers bound to variadic binary columns
        of the data source. This limit does not (directly) apply to the size of the created arrow
